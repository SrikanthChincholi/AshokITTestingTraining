Data Abstraction Rules
-----------------------------------------------------
If anyone of the method is marked as abstract then class should be declared as abstract

abstract classes can have concrete and abstract methods

We cannot create object for abstract classes

We can create constructor for abstract classes

methods declared as private, final, static along with abstract is invalid combination


Rules of Interfaces
------------------------------------------------------
interface can have only methods with public, private, abstract, default, static and strictfp
 
interfaces cannot have methods declared as private, final, static along with abstract

We cannot create object for interfaces

We cannot create constructor for interfaces

We cannot override interface variables as they are defined as final


Interfaces vs abstract classes

extends vs implements
